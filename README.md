# interview-practice-app
A Windows Forms app in C# for recording responses to randomly generated interview questions

## Usage
The goal of this app is to record responses to interview questions so you can play back and review your responses. You will be able to utilize a detectable camera of your choice and select between HR type questions or STAR questions

## Roadmap
There are quite a few things that I would like to implement in this project in the future.
- [ ] Connecting the forms
- [ ] The option to select different folder paths for the save file

Other potential add ons:
- [ ] Adding technical questions
